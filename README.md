## Delving into the Boston Fingerprints Project Archive: A SPARC Teaching Resource

This repository contains teaching materials designed to introduce university level students to working with archived digital 3D models. It introduces terminology and metadata specific to digital 3D data and provides step-by-step instructions for five exercises in the reanalysis and reinterpretation of models collected through the [SPARC Project](https://sparc.cast.uark.edu/). Video tutorials of each exercise are provided on the [SPARC Teaching YouTube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp3iM6q1K7K77VTb0GoEl-Q/featured)

## The Basics of Creating Digital Archaeological Reconstructions: A SPARC Teaching Resource
This repository contains teaching materials designed to introduce university level students to key considerations, issues, and current scholarship surrounding the creation of digital reconstructions of archaeological resources. Using laser scan data produced by [SPARC](https://sparc.cast.uark.edu/) for the [Malthi Revisited](https://www.sia.gr/en/articles.php?tid=140&page=1) project, six exercises provide step-by-step instructions to guide students through critically considering what is needed for a digital reconstruction, processing the dataset into a usable form, and deciding how to disseminate the reconstruction to a wider audience.
