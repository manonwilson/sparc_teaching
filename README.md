## Delving into the Boston Fingerprints Project Archive: A SPARC Teaching Resource

This repository contains teaching materials designed to introduce university level students to working with archived digital 3D models. It introduces terminology and metadata specific to digital 3D data and provides step-by-step instructions for five exercises in the reanalysis and reinterpretation of models collected through the [SPARC Project](https://sparc.cast.uark.edu/). Video tutorials of each exercise are provided on the [SPARC Teaching YouTube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp3iM6q1K7K77VTb0GoEl-Q/featured)
