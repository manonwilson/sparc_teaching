# Conclusion
Through these five exercises, you have been introduced to a range of basic tools, concepts, and methods of dissemination to enable you to create digital reconstructions of archaeological sites. 

- You understand the decisions that need to be made before beginning an archaeological reconstruction. 
- You know how to interrogate a software’s documentation to identify the tools that suit your needs. 
- You are aware of the ambiguity inherent in archaeology and how to record your decision-making process. 
- You can critique archived 3D datasets and process them into usable assets for an archaeological reconstruction.
- You are able to discuss the research insights that can be gained from the process of reconstruction.
- You are aware of a range of potential outputs and venues for digital reconstructions; you’ve learned to identify their strengths and weaknesses, and how to choose the best fit for your project and intended audience.
## Reflect and Go Further
This is by no means a comprehensive guide, but it is intended as a starting point from which you can pursue further skill development, creative endeavours, or research topics on your own initiative. There may be dimensions not covered in these exercises that have piqued your interest (ie. sound, lighting, realistic rendering, populating scenes with non-playable characters, archiving practices, etc.) – but you are now familiar with the terminology and can search for further information on these aspects. Use the resources provided at the end of each Exercise to begin your search.
